FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_CTKG,'Coasters! Building increasingly difficult coasters to satisfy the Coaster King.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_CVRN,'An exotic grotto has been discovered, and restricted planning permission grants you the opportunity to create a unique park in this hollowed out habitat!  Building above the cavern is strictly prohibited, and guest numbers are limited, so you’ll need to conquer the depths to ensure this venture is a success.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_GLLY,'They said no one could build a theme park at Molly's Gully. Prove them wrong! Keep below the height restriction and bankroll the construction of a colossal coaster!'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_GOLM,'The enormous golem's rampage has finally come to an end, frozen in eternal battle against the M.U.T.T.s. Our experts claim the creature is dormant, but local staff don't seem convinced; they're demanding a premium to work here! Utilise the monorail to make the most of the space and create a truly unique sci-fi theme park.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_KRKN,'Rumours of engineers meeting sticky ends scared off this park's staff, leading to its recent sale. The bargain price presents an irresistible opportunity, so hire some new staff, complete construction of the park and ignore the reports of strange noises underground. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about...'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_MNLH,'A strange object found in the desert appears to have exerted an unexpected effect on the park’s rides – everything keeps breaking down and we’re running out of cash. Hire some mechanics, utilise work rosters to fix and maintain the rides, combat the Monolith’s power and get the park back in profit.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_NENC,'The government recently sold off a tract of restricted land to private buyers, which was promptly snapped up by an ambitious theme park operation. Shortly after their grand opening, this sci-fi themed park's management mysteriously disappeared, along with all their research. Keep this park in the black, earn enough to research new rides and make this strange park a success.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_NOMO,'You'll need to be at the top of your game for this one! The former owners have abandoned this park and left it in a real mess; negative cash reserves, a huge loan to pay off, ludicrous layout, and some seriously inefficient amusement rides. If you can turn this around it'll be a miracle.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_ODML,'This futuristic park's shop franchisors have questioned their long term commitment after underwhelming financial results. Retain their trust by squeezing as much profit as possible from your shops and facilities. Layout and pricing choices are key, and canny tycoons will make use of the ready-built shopfronts.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_PBTL,'Avast me hearties, and welcome to Planet Coaster! Shiver those timbers and take charge of this explosive pirate park. Complete ride construction, draw in the crowds and give your guests a swashbuckling good time!'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_PIRT,'Former Pirate turned entrepreneur Peg-Leg Pete appears to be struggling somewhat; his loan-addled park is incomplete and lacking in fun (if only he could remember where he buried his treasure... It was around here somewhere). Take the helm and turn things around before this ship capsizes!'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_SKLL,'The Skull? It appeared one day, rising from the earth in search of vengeance, I reckon. Some say it’s cursed but all I know is that it makes people unhappy. We need your help to counteract the skull’s effect or the park will never recover. Keep guests happy and keep them in the park. Hire entertainers, run marketing campaigns, do what you gotta do to keep the money coming in.'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_SSMR,'The Silversmith family are opening a theme park in the grounds of their estate to tackle their runaway debts. Your job is to build a successful park and keep the place afloat, with just a few caveats... The Silversmiths are rather old fashioned and will only allow ‘traditional’ attractions, so you may want to aim your Marketing efforts at families and ensure your ride sequences offer value for money. Oh, and build carefully, as the estate will take a percentage of any refunds... Good luck!'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_TGTR,'They say this tree is the heart of the world. Can you respect mother nature and craft an eco-friendly theme park around the towering tree, or will you sell the woodland for profit and squeeze as much as you can from this verdant environment?'
FrontEndMenu_ScenarioDetails_WNTR,'It’s time to unwrap our plans for a festive-themed park in this jolly location. Just remember that your cash is a loan, not a gift! Spruce up your winter wonderland with seasonal scenery and draw in the merry crowds from far around.'
